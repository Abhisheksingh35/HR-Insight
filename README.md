# HR ANALYSIS DASHBOARD FOR EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT

## Introduction:
The HR Analysis Dashboard is a powerful tool designed to help HR professionals make data-driven decisions and gain comprehensive insights into employee management. With a wide range of features, the dashboard provides valuable information on gender distribution, promotion eligibility, potential retrenchment, job levels, service years, distance from home to office, retrenchment rates, employee job satisfaction, number of top-rated employees, performance ratings, and overtime response. This project description outlines the main functionalities and key benefits of the HR Analysis Dashboard.

## Features and Functionality:

### Employee Demographics:
•	The dashboard presents a visual representation of the total number of employees categorized by gender, offering a clear overview of the gender distribution within the company.

### Promotion Eligibility Analysis:
•	By identifying employees who have not been promoted for 10 years since their last promotion, the dashboard helps HR professionals determine individuals who are due for promotion. Additionally, it provides a breakdown of employees categorized as not due for promotion, allowing for focused career development initiatives.

### Potential Retrenchment Analysis:
•	The dashboard flags employees who have been with the company for the past 18 years as potentially at risk of facing the retrenchment process. This insight empowers HR professionals to take proactive measures, address potential retrenchment risks, and devise strategies to mitigate their impact.

### Job Level, Service Year, and Distance Analysis:
•	Using job levels, service years, and the distance of employees' homes from the office, the dashboard enables HR professionals to gain valuable insights into workforce composition. By categorizing distances as very far, close, or very close, it assists in making informed decisions regarding job placements, career development, and commuting policies.

### Retrenchment Rate and Potential Retrenchment Analysis:
•	The dashboard calculates the retrenchment rate and identifies departments, job roles, and employee job satisfaction levels that may contribute to a higher likelihood of retrenchment. Job satisfaction ratings are categorized as low, medium, or high. This analysis empowers HR professionals to pinpoint areas of concern and implement targeted strategies to minimize potential retrenchment risks.

### Top-rated Employees and Performance Ratings:
•	Based on performance ratings, the dashboard highlights top-rated employees within the organization, distinguishing between high and low ratings. This feature facilitates the recognition and reward of exceptional performers, fostering a culture of excellence and motivation.

### Overtime Response Analysis:
•	By analysing employee responses to overtime requests, the dashboard provides insights into employees' willingness to work beyond regular hours. This information helps HR professionals optimize resource allocation and identify individuals who demonstrate dedication and flexibility.

### Severance Benefits Calculation:
•	The dashboard determines the number of employees who may face retrenchment while also being due for promotion. These employees are entitled to severance benefits upon leaving the company. By calculating the severance benefits owed to them, the dashboard streamlines the process and ensures fair treatment.

## Insights from the Project:
1.	Our company boasts a workforce of 1,470 employees, with a majority of 60% being men and 40% women. This reflects a balanced gender distribution within the organization.
2.	It is noteworthy that a significant number of employees, around 5 years' worth, have been serving the company diligently. Additionally, the highest concentration of employees belongs to Level 1 job categories, indicating a strong base of entry-level talent.
3.	Based on our analysis, more than 50% of employees reside in close proximity to their workplace, highlighting the convenience and accessibility of our office location.
4.	Our research and development department stands out as having the highest proportion of employees eligible for both promotion and potential retrenchment. It is essential to strategize and address the career progression and job security of these employees effectively.
5.	The feedback received indicates that employee job satisfaction levels are relatively low, signalling the need for initiatives aimed at improving employee relations. Implementing targeted development programs can help enhance employee satisfaction and engagement.
6.	An interesting finding reveals that approximately 70% of employees are not willing to work overtime. To address this, considering better compensation and incentives for overtime work can encourage a more positive response and potentially improve employee flexibility.
7.	The project analysis indicates a significant presence of low-performing employees within the organization. Implementing cross-training programs can be a promising approach to uplift their performance. Furthermore, introducing an incentive system based on challenges and rewards can motivate employees to strive for excellence.
8.	Among the various job roles, sales executive positions have the highest representation within the company, indicating the importance of sales-related functions in our operations.
9.	Notably, employees due for promotion are primarily concentrated in managerial job roles. These individuals also face the highest risk of potential retrenchment. It is crucial to develop comprehensive plans to address both their career advancement opportunities and potential retrenchment scenarios effectively.
These insights provide valuable guidance for our HR strategy and decision-making processes, enabling us to create a supportive and growth-oriented work environment for our employees. By implementing targeted initiatives and fostering effective communication channels, we aim to enhance employee satisfaction, performance, and overall organizational success.
